    \033[0m

    Snapshots are extremely resource/network intensive and are best performed
    in the wee-hours.

    Snapshots will be written to:
      $REPO_ROOT/snapshots

    if you would like to write elsewhere, pass SNAPSHOTS_DIR as an extravar
      bin/snapshots --extra-vars \"SNAPSHOTS_DIR=/nfs/scratch/or/something\"
