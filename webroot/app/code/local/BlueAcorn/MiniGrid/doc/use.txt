In the system.xml of your module, you can define the minigrid as a frontend_type.
Please note, the backend model is required. There is also a source model abstract
which will get you started in defining your own sources. The source model for the
minigrid is specialized and does not work like normal source models (such as select)
so take note of the format specified in the abstract before writing your own.

The source model abstract can be found at: 
BlueAcorn_MiniGrid_Model_System_Config_Source_Minigrid_Abstract


Example use of minigrid in system.xml:

<field translate="label">
    <label>Field</label>
    <frontend_type>minigrid</frontend_type>
    <backend_model>baminigrid/System_Config_Backend_Minigrid</backend_model>
    <sort_order>0</sort_order>
    <show_in_default>1</show_in_default>
    <show_in_website>0</show_in_website>
    <show_in_store>0</show_in_store>
</field>

The use of label has been specialized in the minigrid. Label is not only the label
that appears to the left of the minigrid as normal but is also used to populate
the minigrid's Add Row button and the default field that the minigrid starts with.
