# README

This is the directory that you should add all new php static code analysis tests to. 

There is a setup.sh script that instantiates a few different varaibles that are useful across the different tasks.
If you are gathering information related to only a single task, then that should go into the BASH script for
that task only.

If you want to use the shared variables, you simply need to add this line at the top of your script:
$ source setup.sh
